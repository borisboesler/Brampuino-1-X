Compiling Brampuino 1-X firmware
--------------------------------

 Brampuino 1-X's firmware and user's manual use generated code. This
 code is derived from XML files. The generated code to compile the
 firmware is part of the software repository to compile the firmware
 without generating it. The generated code for the user's manual must
 be generated prior to manual generation. t can be generated by
 calling make in the top-level directory or in the manual directory.

 The firmware can be compiled with the Arduino IDE v1.0 or higher.
